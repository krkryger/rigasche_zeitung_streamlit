This Streamlit app lets you explore the speed of communication in printed media as reflected in the 19th century newspaper _Rigasche Zeitung_. The data is acquired from the digitized collections of the Latvian National Library and spans from 1802 to 1888 (with 1882 missing). In the 19th century, news from abroad were accompanied by the date and place of origin of the information at hand. Using a complex regular expression, this metadata has been extracted from the newspaper and cleaned, resulting in more than 200 000 entries containing (among other information), the place of origin of the news and its date. Subtracting the origin date from the date of publication gives us the delay experienced by readers in Riga.
